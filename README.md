## Features

Part 1: Setting up the environment

The first part of the project involves setting up the VR environment by creating a room with walls, text, materials, and a skybox. The following tasks were performed:

- Created a room with walls, floor, and ceiling 
- Added text with different colors, sizes, and fonts
- Applied materials to the walls, including a normal map to give the illusion of depth
- Added a skybox to the environment

Part 2: Basic Scripting

The second part of the project involves basic scripting in C# to enable interaction and movement within the VR environment. The following scripts were created:

- Quit Key: This script allows the user to quit the game by pressing the controller button.
- Teleport: This script allows the user to teleport to a different location within the environment using the motion controllers.
- Light Switch: A controller button that changes the light color in the scene.
- Orbiting Moon: A moon that orbits the planet at a steady rate.
